## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into employee attendance patterns at AtliQ Technologies, a Technology Company, using Power BI. By analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Present %, WFH %, and SL % over a three-month period, this analysis identifies trends and areas for improvement that could potentially save the company 20% of their investment in expansion.


### Task List

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list. 
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders. 
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.



## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

- Thursday Presence Gap: A significant presence gap of 90.42% was identified on Thursdays. This indicates the need for targeted improvements in attendance and      engagement strategies for that particular day.
- Friday Work-From-Home Preference: The analysis revealed a substantial work-from-home preference rate of 12.15% on Fridays. This suggests the potential benefit of implementing a formalized remote work policy to enhance employee satisfaction and improve end-of-week workload management.
- Thursday Sick Leave Trend: A trend of 1.30% sick leave on Thursdays was pinpointed. This trend warrants further investigation into the factors affecting employee health on Thursdays and potential strategies for mitigating sick leave.
